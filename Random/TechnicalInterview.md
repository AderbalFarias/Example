### C# Versus

#### ```abstract class``` vs ```interface```
An abstract class allows you to create functionalities that subclasses can implement or override and it also can have have constructors. An interface only allows you to define functionalities, not implement it (however from C# 8.0 on you can have default methods and you also can change modifiers). And whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces.

#### ```System.String``` vs ```System.StringBuilder```
- ```System.String```: It is immutable, it means when a string object is created you cannot modify and you have always to create a new object string type in memory.<br>  
```
    string x = "hi";
    x += "how are you?"; // it's a new string instance, we can't change the old one 
```
- ```System.StringBuilder```: It is mutable, means if you create string builder object then you can perform any operation like insert, replace or append without creating new instance for every time. It will update string at one place in memory doesn't create new space in memory.<br>
```
    StringBuilder strb = new StringBuilder("hi");
    strb.Append("how are you?");
    string x = strb.ToString();
```

#### ```String``` vs ```string```
Essentially, there is no difference between string and String in C#.<br>
String is a class in the .NET framework in the System namespace. The fully qualified name is ```System.String```. Whereas, the lower case string is an alias of ```System.String```.

#### ```Action``` vs ```Func``` vs ```Predicate```
- ```Action```: Delegate (pointer) to a method that takes zero, one or more input parameters but doesn't return anything.<br>
- ```Func```: Delegate (pointer) to a method that takes zero, one or more input parameters and returns a value or reference.<br>
- ```Predicate```: A special form of Func and mainly used to validate something and return bool. It is mainly used with collections to whether the item in the collection is valid or not. Basically, its a wrapper of Func like ```Func<T, bool>```.<br>
*When to use that*?<br>
Action is useful if we donâ€™t want to return any result. But if we want to return result, we could use Func. Predicate is mainly to used to validate any condition.

#### Deferred Execution vs Immediate Execution
- Deferred Execution: It simply means that the query is not executed at the time it's specified. Specifically, this is accomplished by assigning the query to a variable. When this is done the query definition is stored in the variable but the query ins't executed until the query variable is interated.
```
    var x = from product in context.Products where product.Type == "y" select product;
    var x = context.Products.Where(w => w.Type == "y");
    foreach(var item x) { Console.WriteLine(item.Name); } // Query executes at x point
```
- Immediate Execution: Query is executed at the point of its declaration. It can be useful if the database is being updated frequently in order to ensure the results where returned at the point the database query is specified. It often uses methods such as ```First(), Avarage(), Sum(), Count(), ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary()```.   
```
    var x = (from product in context.Products where product.Type == "y" select product).ToList();
    var x = context.Products.Where(w => w.Type == "y").ToList();
```

#### Stack vs Heap
In short, in the **Stack** are stored value types (types inherited from ```System.ValueType``` like ```bool, int, long, decimal, float, short```) and in the **Heap** are stored reference types (types inherited from ```System.Object``` such as ```string, object, dynamic```).<br>
Stack is responsible for keeping track what is actually executing and where each executing thread is (each thread has its own stack).<br>
Heap is responsible for keeping track of the data, or more precise objects.

#### ```class``` vs Object
In short, a class is the definition of an object, and an object is an instance of a class.<br>
The class in c# is nothing but a collection of various data members (fields, properties, events, etc.) and member functions. The object in c# is an instance of a class to access the defined properties and methods.

#### Managed vs Unmanaged code
Managed code is the code which is managed by the CLR(Common Language Runtime) in .NET Framework. Whereas the Unmanaged code is the code which is directly executed by the operating system.<br>
- Managed Code: 
    - It is executed by managed runtime environment or managed by the CLR.	
    - It provides security to the application written in .NET Framework.	
    - Memory buffer overflow does not occur.
- Unmanaged Code:
    - It is executed directly by the operating system.
    - It does not provide any security to the application.
    - Memory buffer overflow may occur.
   
#### ```Object.ToString()``` vs ```Convert.ToString()```
```Object.ToString()``` cannot handle ```null``` values which means the *Null reference exception* will be thrown when trying to use ```.ToString()``` on a object which is ```null```, in the other hand ```Convert.ToString()``` can handle ```null``` values it won't generate *Null reference exception*.

#### ```while``` vs ```for```
The difference is that the ```for``` loop is used when you know how many times you need to interate through the code, on the other hand, the ```while``` loop is used when you need to repeat something until a given statement is true.
```
    while(condition == true){}
    for(initializer; condition; iterator){}
```

#### Boxing vs Unboxing
- Boxing is the process of converting a value type to type object.<br>
- Unboxing is the extraction of the value type from the object.<br>
While the boxing is implicit, unboxing is explicit.<br>
```
    int x = 10;
    object myObj = x; // Boxing 
    int y = (int) myObj; // Unboxing
```

#### Constants vs Readonly Variables 
- Constants can be declared in methods or global context they are declared with ```const``` modifier, it is used for immutable values, they are evaluated at compile time, user-defined types, including classes, structs, and arrays, cannot be ```const```.
- Readonly cannot be delcared in methods, they use ```readonly``` modifier, they are evaluated at runtime, it also can hold reference-type variables, it is mostly used when its actual value is unknown before the runtime and it can only be inilialised at the time of declaration or in a constructor.

### C# Keywords

#### Explain the keyword ```virtual```?
The ```virtual``` keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. You cannot use the virtual modifier with the ```static, abstract, private, override``` modifiers.

#### Explain the keyword ```volatile```?
The ```volatile``` keyword indicates that a field might be modified by multiple threads that are executing at the same time. The compiler, the runtime system, and even hardware may rearrange reads and writes to memory locations for performance reasons. Fields that are declared volatile are not subject to these optimizations.

#### Explain the keyword ```using```?
The using keyword has three major uses:<br>
- The using statement defines a scope at the end of which an object will be disposed.
- The using directive creates an alias for a namespace or imports types defined in other namespaces.
- The using static directive imports the members of a single class.

#### Explain the keyword ```unsafe```?
The ```unsafe``` keyword denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operation involving pointers. You can use the ```unsafe``` modifier in the declaration of a type or a member. The entire textual extent of the type or member is therefore considered an unsafe context

#### Explain the keyword ```sealed```?
When applied to a class, the ```sealed``` modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. Like, class **B** inherits from class **A**, but no class can inherit from class **B**
```
    class A {}
    sealed class B : A {}
```

### C# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

#### What is OOP and how does it relate to the .NET Frameworks?
OOP allows .Net developers to create classes containing methods, properties, fields, events and other logical modules. It also let developers create modular programs with they can assemble as applications and reuse code. OOP have four basic features: encapsulation, abstraction, polimorphism and inheritance.

#### What is Encapsulation?
It is one of the four basic features of OOP and refers to an object's ability to hide data and behavior that are not necessary to its user. Encapsulation helps to keep data from unwanted access through biding code and data in an object which is the basic single self-contained unit of a system. Encapsulation is used to restrict access to the members of a class so as to prevent the user of a given class from manipulating objects in ways that are not intended by the designer, it also has the priciple of hiding the state of an object by using private or protected modifiers. Benefits of it:
- Protection of data from accidental corruption.
- Specification of the accessibility of each of the members of a class to the code outside the class.
- Flexibility and extensibility of the code and reduction in complexity.
- Lower coupling between objects and hence improvement in code maintainability.
- Less likely that other objects can modify the state or behavior of the object in question.
```
    public class Bank
    {
        private double balance;
        public double Balance
        {
            get
            {
                return balance;
            }
            set
            {
                balance = value;
            }
        }
    }
```

#### What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is a principle of OOP and it is used to hide the implementation details and display only essential features of the object. The word abstract means a concept or an idea not associated with any specific instance. We apply the same meaning of abstraction by making classes not associated with any specific instance. Abstraction is needed when we need to only inherit from a certain class, but do not need to instantiate objects of that class. In such a case the base class can be regarded as "Incomplete". Such classes are known as an "Abstract Base Class". 
``` 
    public abstract class Animal
    {
        private string Name { get; set; }
        private string Specie { get; set; }

        public Animal()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Do something");
        }

        public Animal(string name, string specie)
        {
            this.Name = name;
            this.Specie = specie;
        }

        public string NameAndSpecie() => $"{Name}, {Specie}"; // concrete method

        public abstract string AnimalType();

        public virtual int AverageLifeInMonths(int years) => years / 12;
    }

    public class Tiger : Animal
    {
        public override string AnimalType() => "Mammals";
    }

    public class Frog : Animal
    {
        public override string AnimalType() => "Amphibians";
    }

    public class Salmon : Animal
    {
        public override string AnimalType() => "Fish";
    }
```

#### What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means providing an ability to take more than one form, polymorphism provides an ability for the classes to implement different methods that are called through the same name and it also provides an ability to invoke the methods of a derived class through base class reference during runtime based on our requirements.
```
    public void AddNumbers(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"a + b = { a + b }");
    }
    
    public void AddNumbers(int a, int b, int c)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"a + b + c = { a + b + c }");
    }
```

#### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of OOP languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another ```class``` for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. It allows developers to reuse, extend and modify the behavior defined in other classes, **the ```class``` whose members are inherited is called the base class and the ```class``` that inherit those members is called the derived class**. Inheritance allows you to define a base class that provides specific functionality (data and behavior) and to define derived classes that either inherit or override that functionality.<br>
*e.g.:* A base class called ```Vehicle```, and then derived classes called ```Truck, Car, Motprcycle``` all of which inherit the attributes of vehicle.
```
    public class A
    {
        public string Name;
        public void GetName() => Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}", Name);
    }

    public class B : A
    {
        public string Location;
        public void GetLocation() => Console.WriteLine("Location: {0}", Location);
    }

    public class C : B
    {
        public int Age;
        public void GetAge() => Console.WriteLine("Age: {0}", Age);
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            C c = new C();
            c.Name = "Test Name";
            c.Location = "Test Location";
            c.Age = 32;

            c.GetName();
            c.GetLocation();
            c.GetAge();
        }
    }
```

#### What is Inversion of Control?
Inversion of control is a *Principle in softeware engineering* by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It is most oftem used in the context of OOP.

### C# Design Patterns

#### Dependency Injection (DI)
Dependency Injection is a software design pattern that allows us to develop loosely coupled code, which is a technique for achieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. DI reduces tight coupling between software components and also enables us to better manage future changes and other complexity in a software. The purpose of DI is to make code maintainable.<br>
Advantages:
- Reduces class coupling.
- Increases code reusability.
- Improves code maintainability.
- Make unit testing possible.

The Dependency Injection pattern involves 3 types of classes:
- Client Class: The client class (dependent class) is a class which depends on the service class
- Service Class: The service class (dependency) is a class that provides service to the client class.
- Injector Class: The injector class injects the service class object into the client class.

Types of Dependency Injection: 
- Constructor Injection: In the constructor injection, the injector supplies the service (dependency) through the client class constructor.
- Property Injection: In the property injection (aka (also known as) the Setter Injection), the injector supplies the dependency through a public property of the client class.
- Method Injection: In this type of injection, the client class implements an interface which declares the method(s) to supply the dependency and the injector uses this interface to supply the dependency to the client class.

Dependency Lifetimes<br>
At registration time, dependencies require a lifetime definition. The service lifetime defines the conditions under which a new service instance will be created. Below are the lifetimes defined by the ASP.Net DI framework. The terminology may be different if you choose to use a different framework.<br>
- **Transient** â€“ Created every time they are requested
- **Scoped** â€“ Created once per scope. Most of the time, scope refers to a web request. But this can also be used for any unit of work, such as the execution of an Azure Function.
- **Singleton** â€“ Created only for the first request. If a particular instance is specified at registration time, this instance will be provided to all consumers of the registration type.

#### [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/AderbalFarias/snippet/blob/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavioral%20Patterns/ChainOfResponsibility.linq)
Chain of Responsibility is a **Behavioral Pattern** that simplifies object interconnections. Instead of senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the chain, and each receiver keeps a single reference to its immediate successor in the chain.<br>
The derived classes know how to satisfy Client requests. If the "current" object is not available or sufficient, then it delegates to the base class, which delegates to the "next" object, and the circle of life continues.

#### [Observer](https://github.com/AderbalFarias/snippet/blob/master/Design%20Patterns/Behavioral%20Patterns/Observer.linq)
The Observer is a **Behavioral Pattern** in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.<br>
Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

### C# Variety 

#### What is ```delegate```?
A ```delegate``` is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with any method with a compatible signature and return type. You can invoke (or call) the method through the delegate instance.<br>
*Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods*. Event handlers are nothing more than methods that are invoked through delegates. 

#### Does C# support multiple inheritance?
No, however, you can implement multiple interfaces.

#### When ```break``` is used inside two nested ```for``` loops (for inside for), the ```break``` is inside second loop, what does happen? 
It breaks from the inner loop only.

#### Explain what LINQ is?
LINQ in an acronym for Language Integrated Query, it allow data manipulation, regardless of the data source which means that it supports many data providers like .NET Framework collections, SQL Server databases, MySql databases, ADO.NET databases, XML documents, and any collection of objects that support ```IEnumerable``` or generic ```IEnumerable<T>``` interfaces, *In short, LINQ bridges the gap between the world of objects and the world of data*.

#### Explain the difference between Task and Thread in .NET?
- Thread represents an actual OS-level thread, with its own stack and kernel resources. Thread allows the highest degree of control; you can ```Abort()``` or ```Suspend()``` or ```Resume()``` a thread, you can observe its state, and you can set thread-level properties like the stack size, apartment state, or culture. ThreadPool is a wrapper around a pool of threads maintained by the CLR.
- The Task class from the Task Parallel Library offers the best of both worlds. Like the ThreadPool, a task does not create its own OS thread. Instead, tasks are executed by a TaskScheduler; the default scheduler simply runs on the ThreadPool. Unlike the ThreadPool, Task also allows you to find out when it finishes, and (via the generic Task) to return a result.

#### What garbage collection is and how it works. Provide example of how you can enforce it in .NET?
Garbage collection is a low-priority process that serves as an automatic memory manager which manages the allocation and release of memory for the applications. Each time a new object is created, the CLR allocates memory for that object from the managed **heap**. As long as free memory space is available in the managed heap the runtime continuos to allocate space for new objects. However memory is not infinite and when heap memory is full garbage collection comes to free some memory.<br>
When **Garbage Collector** performs a collection it checks for objects in the managed heap that are no longer being used by the applications and performs the necessary operations to relcaim the memory, it will stop all running threads and find the objects in the heap that aren't being accessed by the main program and delete them, then reorganize all the objects left in the heap in order to make space and adjust all pointers to these objects in the heap and the stack.<br>
It can be implemented by using the ```IDisposable interface```.<br>
```System.GC.Collect() // Force garbage collection```

### .NET Core

#### Explain what is a Middlaware?
Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. ASP.NET Core provides a rich set of built-in middleware components, but in some scenarios you might want to write a custom middleware. Middleware should follow the Explicit Dependencies Principle by exposing its dependencies in its constructor. Middleware is constructed once per application lifetime, it is possible to create a middleware pipeline with ```IApplicationBuilder``` inside the method ```public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)```. The ASP.NET Core request pipeline consists of a sequence of request delegates, called one after the other.<br>
The incoming requests are passes through this pipeline where all middleware is configured, and middleware can perform some action on the request before passes it to the next middleware. Same as for the responses, they are also passing through the middleware but in reverse order.

#### What are the advantages of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET?
There are following advantages of ASP.NET Core over ASP.NET:
- It is cross-platform, so it can be run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
- There is no dependency on framework installation because all the required dependencies are ship with our application.
- ASP.NET Core can handle more request than the ASP.NET.
- Multiple deployment options available withASP.NET Core.

#### What is the startup class in ASP.NET core?
Startup class is the entry point of the ASP.NET Core application. Every .NET Core application must have this class. This class contains the application configuration. It is not necessary that class name must "Startup.cs", it can be anything, we can configure startup class in Program class.
```
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }

        public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.AddConsole();
                logging.AddDebug();
            })
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            })
            .UseSerilog((context, config) => config.ReadFrom.Configuration(context.Configuration));
    }
    
    public class Startup
    {
        private const string DemoConnection = "DemoConnection";
        private const string corsSettings = "CorsOrigin";
        private string[] Schemes = { JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, "ADFS" };

        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, IWebHostEnvironment environment)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
            Environment = environment;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }
        public IWebHostEnvironment Environment { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. 
        // Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            var corsOrigin = Configuration.GetSection(corsSettings).Get<string[]>();

            services.AddCors(options =>
            {
                options.AddDefaultPolicy(builder =>
                {
                    builder.WithOrigins(corsOrigin).AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod();
                });
            });

            // Dependency Injection
            services.Services();
            services.Repositories();
            services.Databases(Configuration.GetConnectionString(DemoConnection));
            services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection(nameof(AppSettings)));

            var authenticationOption = Configuration
                .GetSection(nameof(ApplicationOptions.Authentication))
                .Get<AuthenticationOptions>();

            services.AddSingleton(authenticationOption);

            services.AddHealthChecks()
                .AddSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString(DemoConnection));

            services.AddControllers();
            services.AddApiVersioning();
            services.AddSwagger(authenticationOption);

            var oidc = Configuration
                .GetSection(nameof(ApplicationOptions.OidcAuthorizationServer))
                .Get<OidcAuthorizationServerOptions>();

            services.AddSingleton(oidc);
            services.AddAuthorization(options =>
            {
                options.DefaultPolicy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                    .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
                    .AddAuthenticationSchemes(Schemes)
                    .Build();
            });

            services.AddBearers(Environment, oidc, authenticationOption, Schemes);
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env, ILogger<Startup> logger)
        {
            app.UseAuthentication();

            logger.LogInformation($"In {env.EnvironmentName} environment");

            app.UseSwagger();
            app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>
            {
                c.SwaggerEndpoint("../swagger/v1/swagger.json", "Core App v1");
                c.RoutePrefix = string.Empty;
            });

            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
                app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionMiddleware>();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionMiddleware>();
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
                app.UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute("/Error/{0}");
                app.UseHsts();

                app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            }

            app.UseRouting();
            app.UseAuthorization();
            app.UseStaticFiles();
            app.UseCors();
            app.UseHealthChecks();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
            {
                endpoints.MapControllers();
            });
        }
    }
```

#### What is the use of ```ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)``` method of startup class?
This is an optional method of startup class. It can be used to configure the services that are used by the application. This method calls first when the application is requested for the first time. Using this method, we can do things like adding services to the DI container, so services are available as a dependency in controller constructor.

#### What is the use of the ```Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env, ILogger<Startup> logger)``` method of startup class?
It defines how the application will respond to each HTTP request. We can configure the request pipeline by configuring the middleware. It accepts IApplicationBuilder as a parameter and also it has two optional parameters: IWebHostEnvironment and ILogger. Using this method, we can configure built-in middleware such as routing, authentication, session, etc. as well as third-party or custom middlewares.

#### What is the difference between ```IApplicationBuilder.Use()``` and ```IApplicationBuilder.Run()```?
We can use both the methods in Configure methods of startup class. Both are used to add middleware delegate to the application request pipeline. 
- ```IApplicationBuilder.Use()``` may call the next middleware in the pipeline 
- ```IApplicationBuilder.Run()``` method never calls the subsequent or next middleware. After ```IApplicationBuilder.Run``` method, system stop adding middleware in request. pipeline.

#### What is routing in ASP.NET Core?
Routing is functionality that map incoming request to the route handler. The route can have values (extract them from URL) that used to process the request. The Routing uses routes for map incoming request with route handler and Generate URL that used in response.
