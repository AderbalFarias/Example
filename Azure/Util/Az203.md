## [Azure Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-programming-guide)

### Create an Event Hubs client

```csharp
private const string EventHubConnectionString = "Event Hubs namespace connection string";
private const string EventHubName = "event hub name";

var connectionStringBuilder = new EventHubsConnectionStringBuilder(EventHubConnectionString)
{
    EntityPath = EventHubName

};
eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionStringBuilder.ToString());
```

### Event serialization
The EventData class has two overloaded constructors that take a variety of parameters, bytes or a byte array, that represent the event data payload. When using JSON with EventData, you can use Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes() to retrieve the byte array for a JSON-encoded string:
```csharp
for (var i = 0; i < numMessagesToSend; i++)
{
    var message = $"Message {i}";
    Console.WriteLine($"Sending message: {message}");
    await eventHubClient.SendAsync(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)));
}
```

### Event consumers
The EventProcessorHost class processes data from Event Hubs. You should use this implementation when building event readers on the .NET platform. EventProcessorHost provides a thread-safe, multi-process, safe runtime environment for event processor implementations that also provides checkpointing and partition lease management.

To use the EventProcessorHost class, you can implement IEventProcessor. This interface contains four methods:  
OpenAsync  
CloseAsync  
ProcessEventsAsync  
ProcessErrorAsync   

## [Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview)
The basic structure of a query is a source table followed by a series of operators separated by a pipe character |. You can chain together multiple operators to refine the data and perform advanced functions.

```
Event
| where (EventLevelName == "Error")
| where (TimeGenerated > ago(1days))
| summarize ErrorCount = count() by Computer
| top 10 by ErrorCount desc
```
Or maybe you want to find computers that haven't had a heartbeat in the last day.
```
Heartbeat
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| summarize max(TimeGenerated) by Computer
| where max_TimeGenerated < ago(1d)  
```
How about a line chart with the processor utilization for each computer from last week?
```
Perf
| where ObjectName == "Processor" and CounterName == "% Processor Time"
| where TimeGenerated  between (startofweek(ago(7d)) .. endofweek(ago(7d)) )
| summarize avg(CounterValue) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 5min)
| render timechart    
```

## [Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview)
Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.

## [Advanced usage of authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-how-to)
Access token e.g.  
X-MS-TOKEN-FACEBOOK-ACCESS-TOKEN   
X-MS-TOKEN-FACEBOOK-EXPIRES-ON  


## [Use Azure Key Vault with an Azure web app in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/tutorial-net-create-vault-azure-web-app)
### Create a resource group
```bash
# To list locations: az account list-locations --output table
az group create --name "<YourResourceGroupName>" --location "West US"
```
### Create a key vault
To create a key vault in your resource group, provide the following information:  
Key vault name: a string of 3 to 24 characters that can contain only numbers (0-9), letters (a-z, A-Z), and hyphens (-)  
Resource group name  
Location: West US  
```bash
az keyvault create --name "<YourKeyVaultName>" --resource-group "<YourResourceGroupName>" --location "West US"
```

### Add a secret to the key vault
To create a secret in the key vault called AppSecret, enter the following command:  
```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "<YourKeyVaultName>" --name "AppSecret" --value "MySecret"
```
This secret stores the value MySecret.  
To view the value that's contained in the secret as plain text, enter the following command:  
```bash
az keyvault secret show --name "AppSecret" --vault-name "<YourKeyVaultName>"
```
