## [Planning a cloud-based Azure Multi-Factor Authentication deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)

People are connecting to organizational resources in increasingly complicated scenarios. People connect from organization-owned, personal, and public devices on and off the corporate network using smart phones, tablets, PCs, and laptops, often on multiple platforms. In this always-connected, multi-device and multi-platform world, the security of user accounts is more important than ever. Passwords, no matter their complexity, used across devices, networks, and platforms are no longer sufficient to ensure the security of the user account, especially when users tend to reuse passwords across accounts. Sophisticated phishing and other social engineering attacks can result in usernames and passwords being posted and sold across the dark web.

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) helps safeguard access to data and applications. It provides an additional layer of security using a second form of authentication. Organizations can use Conditional Access to make the solution fit their specific needs.
